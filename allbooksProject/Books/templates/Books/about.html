    <h1>About </h1>
    <p>
        Born in 1978 and raised in the vibrant cultural landscape of Haiti, I embarked on an education journey that shaped both my intellect and character. Pursuing higher education in Haiti instilled in me a deep appreciation for learning and cultural diversity. After High school I enrolled to attend one of the most prestigious branches of the University of the State of Haiti. That early exposure ignited a passion for understanding different perspectives, and fueled my drive to strive to make a meaningful impact on this world. My favorite subjects were: history, geography, history of ideas, philosophy, and history of the ancient world, especially Egypt and Timbuktu. It was while attending the Ecole Normale Superieure, I received a permanent visa to enter the United States of America. That sudden transition was not easy, but it broadened my academic perspective, as well as exposing me to the rich diversity of cultures present in the international educational setting. The transformative experience of attending college in the USA has prepared me for the next chapter of my life. A chapter marked by unwavering dedication to the United States Army.

Driven by a profound sense of duty and patriotism, and pushed by my quest for knowledge, I answered the call to serve in 2008. I enlisted in the United States Army, eager to contribute my skills to a higher cause. My service led me to two deployments, and both were in extremely challenging landscapes. My first time in a war zone was in Afghanistan (OEF: Operation Enduring Freedom 08-09), and second time was in Iraq (OND: Operation New Dawn 11-12). In both places, more so in Afghanistan, I faced the challenges of conflict zones with resilience and determination. These two places have not only tested my physical endurance but also my ability to lead and collaborate under intense pressure and circumstances. The Army has amplified the importance of adaptability and open-mindedness in me as it strives to do with all soldiers. As a member of the military, I honed my leadership skills, fostered teamwork, and developed an unwavering commitment to duty, qualities that would define my journey through the armed forces.

        Following deployments in the Middle East, my military service took an unexpected turn as I embarked on a transformative journey across the rich tapestry of Europe. This experience has not just expanded my cultural awareness, it also allowed me to witness first hand that there is an interconnectedness of nations, as well as helping me understand the utmost importance of global cooperation. Despite the challenges, I emerge with a profound appreciation for the diversity that exists within the international community. That expedition offered me a profound appreciation for global perspectives, and further honed my capacity to navigate diverse environments. As fate would have it, my military journey took an unexpected turn in 2014, leading to a chapter of resilience and adaptation. Medically retired due to lower back and a plethora of other issues acquired in the service, I transitioned into a new phase of life. Having served the star spangled banner and its nation with honor and dedication, equipped with a wealth of experiences that have shaped my character and perspective on the world; I draw upon the strength cultivated through education and military service. This Haitian born in the deep rural zone Coupe-a-L’Inde in the north of Haiti, has now a narrative that embodies a fusion of diverse cultures, unwavering dedication to service, and the ability to triumph over unforeseen challenges. Ever since attending

the state university of Haiti, I had that dream of publishing something for posterity. Unfortunately, that was an economical impossibility back then. I wrote to every single country’s embassy in Haiti in 2001 and 2002 asking for help, every single one of them wrote back to tell me that their “cultural department had no funds available for such an endeavor.” At least they did not ignore my letters, although unfavorable, they replied. The dream did not die. With the push and encouragement from Ayesha W. Jean, Phebe Rene and my brothers: Wilquens and Athanase, my friend Hlay Aliotte etc, I started writing again. And 22 years later, my first book was published. It’s a poem book titled; “My Soul Laid Bare…Why Not” in which I laid it all out with no reservation. I expose my struggles, my anger towards everything negatively exploitative, my deepest thoughts and feelings as well as my hopes. It is written in a way that the reader is actually an interlocutor. Ayesha W. Jean arranged and published it herself. She did an amazing job. I would deeply appreciate all feedback, especially positive ones. More poem books will follow, but my upcoming book will not be poetic but instead a story of the life of an orphan boy named Abhipada, struggling but determined to succeed by any means necessary…Be patient and stay tuned.
